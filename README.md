# NFT Marketplace Smart Contract

This project demonstrates the creation of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) using Solidity, Hardhat, and TypeScript. The contract allows users to mint NFTs. The project leverages OpenZeppelin's ERC721 standard and includes features such as metadata storage and ownership management.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: The smart contracts are written in Solidity, a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Hardhat is used for managing the smart contract development workflow.
- **TypeScript**: The scripts for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts are written in TypeScript, providing type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **OpenZeppelin**: A library for secure smart contract development. The project uses OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation for creating NFTs.
- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used for storing NFT metadata, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.

## Project Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts.
  - `NFT.sol`: Defines the NFT contract with minting, metadata storage, and ownership management.
- **scripts/**: Contains the deployment and interaction scripts.
  - `deploy.ts`: Script to deploy the NFT and marketplace contracts.
  - `createNFT.ts`: Script to create a new NFT with metadata.
- **typechain/**: Contains TypeScript bindings for the smart contracts, generated by TypeChain.
- **artifacts/**: Contains the compiled contract artifacts.
- **cache/**: Contains cached files for the Solidity compiler.

## Key Features

- **NFT Creation**: Users can create new NFTs by providing metadata stored on IPFS.
- **Listing and Buying**: NFTs can be listed for sale and purchased by other users.
- **Ownership Management**: The contracts ensure secure transfer and management of NFT ownership.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Smart Contract Development**: Writing secure and efficient smart contracts using Solidity.
- **Blockchain Development**: Deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **TypeScript**: Using TypeScript for writing deployment and interaction scripts, ensuring type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Using IPFS for storing NFT metadata, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Using Hardhat for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Hardhat installed globally (`npm install -g hardhat`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-marketplace-smart-contract.git
   cd nft-marketplace-smart-contract
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Deployment

1.  Compile the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Deploy the contracts to a local Hardhat network:
   ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
   ```
3. Create a new NFT with metadata:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/createNFT.ts --network localhost
   ```
